Little Red Riding hood walked back down the path.
She emerged from the woods.
Oddly, there was no more traffic in the street.
She crossed the empty street without event.
The whole neighborhood was oddly quiet.
She walked up to her "mother's" door and pushed it open.
"Oh, welcome back, Little Red Riding Hood!" Her mother's nervous voice erupted from the kitchen.
Little red riding hood noted how dark it was in the house. She made her way to the kitchen and peered around the corner.
Her mother faced away from her, happily washing the dishes. She turned, her face sweating and nervous. The woman shook, and she dropped 
the dish she was holding. It shattered into five pieces on the ground.
"Oh, welcome back!" She said again, "That was quick! Did you give Grandmother her food? Was she hungry?"
Little Red Riding Hood felt a bit angry. Her mother had known that that witch was not her grandmother. 
She probably knew her inclination for eating children as well.
The anger grew inside.
"Well, answer me, you little brat! Was the old woman hungry or not?"
