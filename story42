Lifting the heavy latch, hefting the heavy hamper, Little Red Riding Hood pushed open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside.
A vast room stretched before her, heavily shadowed, with a few burning candles dripping here and there. 
Tall shapes that could be crowded tables were shouldering each other, and these tables were covered with things.
Big jars of murky liquid with things floating inside. Giant dog-eared books strewn with loose notes. Bottles of various shapes and sizes.
Old, rusty jewelry strewn here and there.
Dirty dishes cluttered the floor, covered with old food and mold.
Hanging from the cieling looked like groups of crowded bats taking a nap. But they were trappings. Dead animals.
The stench in the room was unbearable. Heavy. Sickly sweet. Little Red Riding hood covered her nose and mouth, trying to breathe shallowly.
"Do come in and close the door," Intoned the woman's scratchy voice again, "You're letting in the fresh air."
Little Red Riding Hood reluctantly obeyed her.
"Come closer, my child," said the voice from the gloom. Little Red Riding hood inched forward, picking her way over the smashed dishes 
and newspapers. As she walked forward, she saw a small desk littered with long cards, skulls of various animals, and one single glass globe.
A hulking shadow hunched behind it. From the shadow, a long, crooked finger beckoned.
"Come and have your cards read, my dear,"
Little red riding hood set down the hamper and climbed onto a chair. 
"Give me your hand,"
Little Red Riding hood held out her hand. A large wrinkled one snatched it. It was cold and clammy.
It scrabbled about on her hand, scratching her palm, then the voice cackled with glee.
"You?!" It laughed, "The girl from the fire? Surely they didn't send you!"
With her other hand, Little Red Riding Hood pulled her hood down to more cover her face.
